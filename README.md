## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/decentral-inc/decentral.git themes/decentral
```

## Enable

1.  **Add example pages.**

    Copy all of the contents of `themes/decentral/_source` to `source`.
    This includes a sample landing page and contact, project, and
    about pages.

    ```bash
    cp -r themes/decentral/_source/* source
    ```

2.  **Enable theme.**
    Modify the root site `_config.yml` so that `theme` is set to `decentral`.

    ```yml
    # Extensions
    ## Plugins: http://hexo.io/plugins/
    ## Themes: http://hexo.io/themes/
    theme: decentral
    ```

# Extensions

## Plugins: http://hexo.io/plugins/

## Themes: http://hexo.io/themes/

theme: decentral

    ```

    Finally, run `npm install` and then `hexo server` to test out the site.

3.  **Optional: Enable custom landing page.**

    To use custom landing page instead of the default archive index, remove
    the line containing hexo-generator-index from package.json in the project root.
    Then, edit `source/index.ejs`.

### Update

```bash
cd themes/decentral
git pull
```

  Projects: /projects/
  Blog: /archives/ # can set archive-dir in root config to custom value
  Contact: /contact/
  About: /about/
```

Finally, don't forget to save your swiftype configuration to complete the installation.
